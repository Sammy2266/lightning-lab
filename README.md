# Shushtar

![CI](https://github.com/lightninglabs/shushtar/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

** insert screenshot here **

Shushtar is a browser-based interface for managing the off-chain liquidity of your `lnd` Lightning Network node. It presents a visual representation of your channels and balances, while allowing you to perform submarine swaps via the [Lightning Loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop) service using a graphical interface. With a bird's eye view of all of your open channels, you can instantly see which ones need your immediate attention.

You can configure the UI to classify channels according to your node's operating mode.

- **Optimize for Receiving**: For merchants who primarily receive inbound Lightning payments, the channels with high local balances will be shaded red.
- **Optimize for Routing**: For routing node operators, that want to keep their channels balanced close to 50%, the channels with a high balance in either direction will be flagged.
- **Optimize for Sending**: For exchanges, fiat gateways, and other operators who primarily send outgoing Lightning payments, the channels with high local balances will be shaded red.

## Architecture

Shushtar is packaged as a single binary which contains the [`lnd`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd), [`loopd`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/loop) and [`faraday`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/faraday) daemons all in one. It also contains an HTTP server to serve the web assets (html/js/css) and a GRPC proxy to forward web requests from the browser to the appropriate GRPC server. This deployment strategy was chosen as it greatly simplifies the operational overhead of installation, configuration and maintenance that would be necessary to run each of these servers independently. You only need to download one executable and run one command to get Shushtar up and running. We include the CLI binaries `lncli`, `loop` and `frcli` for convenience in the downloadable archives as well.

## Installation

There are two options for installing Shushtar: download the published binaries for your platform, or compile from source code.

#### Download Binaries

Shushtar binaries for many platforms are made available on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/lightninglabs/shushtar/releases) page in this repo. There you can download the latest version and extract the archive into a directory on your computer.

#### Compile from Source Code

To compile from source code, you'll need to have some prerequisite developer tooling installed on your machine.

- **Go**: Shushtar's backend web server is written in Go. Instructions for installing Go for your operating system can be found on the [golang install](https://golang.org/doc/install) page. The minimum version supported is Go v1.13.
- **NodeJS**: Shushtar's frontend is written in TypeScript and built on top of the React JS web framework. To bundle the assets into Javascript & CSS compatible with web browsers, NodeJS is required. It can be downloaded and installed by following the instructions on the [NodeJS download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page.

Once you have the necessary prerequisites, Shushtar can be compiled by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/lightninglabs/shushtar.git
cd shushtar
make && make install
```

This will produce the `shushtar` executable and add it to your `GOPATH`.

## Configuration

Shushtar only has a few configuration parameters itself.

#### Required

You must set `httpslisten` to the host & port that the https server should listen on. Also set `uipassword` to a strong password to use to login to the website in your browser. A minimum of 8 characters is required. In a production environment, it's recommended that you store this password as an environment variable.

#### Optional

You can also configure the HTTP server to automatically install a free SSL certificate provided by [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). This is recommended if you plan to access the website from a remote computer and do not want to deal with the browser warning you about the self-signed certificate. You just need to specify the domain name you wish to use, and make sure port 80 is open in your in your firewall. LetsEncrypt requires this to verify that you own the domain name. Shushtar will listen on port 80 to handle the verification requests. On some linux-based platforms, you may need to run Shushtar with superuser privileges since port 80 is a system port.

> Note: Shushtar only serves content over **HTTPS**. If you do not use `letsencrypt`, Shushtar will use the self-signed certificate that is auto-generated by `lnd` to encrypt the browser-to-server communication. Web browsers will display a warning when using the self-signed certificate.

```
Application Options:
      --httpslisten=      host:port to listen for incoming HTTP/2 connections on (default: 127.0.0.1:8443)
      --uipassword=       the password that must be entered when using the loop UI. use a strong
                          password to protect your node from unauthorized access through the web UI
      --letsencrypt       use Let's Encrypt to create a TLS certificate for the UI instead of using
                          lnd's TLS certificate. port 80 must be free to listen on and must be reachable
                          from the internet for this to work
      --letsencrypthost=  the host name to create a Let's Encrypt certificate for'
      --letsencryptdir=   the directory where the Let's Encrypt library will store its key and
                          certificate (default: /Users/jamal/Library/Application Support/Lnd/letsencrypt)
```

You must also provide configuration to the `lnd` daemon. Each flag must be prefixed with `lnd.` (ex: `lnd.lnddir=~/.lnd`). Please see the [sample-lnd.conf](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/sample-lnd.conf) file for more details on the available parameters. Note that `loopd` and `faraday` will automatically connect to the in-process `lnd` node, so you do not need to provide them with any additional parameters unless you want to override them. If you do override them, be sure to add the `loop.` and `faraday.` prefixes.

Here is an example command to start `shushtar` on testnet with a local `bitcoind` node:

```
$ ./shushtar \
  --httpslisten=0.0.0.0:443 \
  --uipassword=My$trongP@ssword \
  --letsencrypt \
  --letsencrypthost=loop.merchant.com \
  --lnd.lnddir=/root/.lnd \
  --lnd.alias=merchant \
  --lnd.externalip=loop.merchant.com \
  --lnd.rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009 \
  --lnd.listen=0.0.0.0:9735 \
  --lnd.bitcoin.active \
  --lnd.bitcoin.testnet \
  --lnd.bitcoin.node=bitcoind \
  --lnd.bitcoind.rpchost=localhost \
  --lnd.bitcoind.rpcuser=testnetuser \
  --lnd.bitcoind.rpcpass=testnetpw \
  --lnd.bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=localhost:28332 \
  --lnd.bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=localhost:28333 \
  --lnd.debuglevel=debug \
  --loop.loopoutmaxparts=5 \
  --faraday.min_monitored=48h
```

You can also store the configuration in a persistent 'lnd.conf' file so you do not need to type in the command line arguments every time you start the server. Just remember to use the `lnd.` prefix.

Example `lnd.conf`:

```
[Application Options]
httpslisten=0.0.0.0:443
letsencrypt=1
letsencrypthost=loop.merchant.com

[Lnd]
lnd.lnddir=~/.lnd
lnd.alias=merchant
lnd.externalip=loop.merchant.com
lnd.rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009
lnd.listen=0.0.0.0:9735
lnd.debuglevel=debug

[Bitcoin]
lnd.bitcoin.active
lnd.bitcoin.testnet
lnd.bitcoin.node=bitcoind

[Bitcoind]
lnd.bitcoind.rpchost=localhost
lnd.bitcoind.rpcuser=testnetuser
lnd.bitcoind.rpcpass=testnetpw
lnd.bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=localhost:28332
lnd.bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=localhost:28333

[Loop]
loopoutmaxparts=5

[Faraday]
min_monitored=48h

```

The default location for the `lnd.conf` file will depend on your operating system:

- **On MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Lnd/lnd.conf`
- **On Linux**: `~/.lnd/lnd.conf`
- **On Windows**: `~/AppData/Roaming/Lnd/lnd.conf`

### Upgrade Existing Nodes

If you already have existing `lnd`, `loop`, or `faraday` nodes, you can easily upgrade them to the Shushtar single executable while keeping all of your past data.

For `lnd`:

- if you use an `lnd.conf` file for configurations, add the `lnd.` prefix to each of the configuration parameters.
  Before:
  ```
  [Application Options]
  alias=merchant
  ```
  After:
  ```
  [Application Options]
  lnd.alias=merchant
  ```
- if you use command line arguments for configuration, add the `lnd.` prefix to each argument to `shushtar`
  Before:
  ```
  $ lnd --lnddir=~/.lnd --alias=merchant ...
  ```
  After:
  ```
  $ shushtar lnd.lnddir=~/.lnd --lnd.alias=merchant ...
  ```

For `loop`:

- if you use an `loop.conf` file for configurations, copy the parameters into the `lnd.conf` file that `shushtar` uses, and add the `loop.` prefix to each of the configuration parameters.

  Before: (in `loop.conf`)

  ```
  [Application Options]
  loopoutmaxparts=5
  ```

  After: (in `lnd.conf`)

  ```
  [Loop]
  loop.loopoutmaxparts=5
  ```

- if you use command line arguments for configuration, add the `loop.` prefix to each argument to `shushtar`
  Before:
  ```
  $ loop --loopoutmaxparts=5 --debuglevel=debug ...
  ```
  After:
  ```
  $ shushtar --loop.loopoutmaxparts=5 --loop.debuglevel=debug ...
  ```

For `faraday`:

- the standalone `faraday` daemon does not load configuration from file, but you can now store the parameters into the `lnd.conf` file that `shushtar` uses. Just add the `faraday.` prefix to each of the configuration parameters.

  Before: (from command line)

  ```
  $ faraday --min_monitored=48h
  ```

  After: (in `lnd.conf`)

  ```
  [Faraday]
  faraday.min_monitored=48h
  ```

- if you use command line arguments for configuration, add the `faraday.` prefix to each argument to `shushtar`
  Before:
  ```
  $ faraday --min_monitored=48h --debuglevel=debug ...
  ```
  After:
  ```
  $ shushtar --faraday.min_monitored=48h --faraday.debuglevel=debug...
  ```

### Troubleshooting

If you have trouble running your node, please first check the logs for warnings or errors.

#### Server

Server-side logs are stored in the directory specified by `lnd.lnddir` in your configuration. Inside, there is a `logs` dir containing the log files in subdirectories.

#### Browser

Client-side logs are disabled by default in production builds. Logging can be turned on by adding a couple keys to your browser's `localStorage`. Simply run these two JS statements in you browser's DevTools console then refresh the page:

```
localStorage.setItem('debug', '*'); localStorage.setItem('debug-level', 'debug');
```

The value for `debug` is a namespace filter which determines which portions of the app to display logs for. The namespaces currently used by the app are as follows:

- `main`: logs general application messages
- `action`: logs all actions that modify the internal application state
- `grpc`: logs all GRPC API requests and responses

Example filters: `main,action` will only log main and action messages. `*,-action` will log everything except action messages.

The value for `debug-level` determines the verbosity of the logs. The value can be one of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.
