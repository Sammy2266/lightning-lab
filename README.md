## Features
- Visualize your channels and balances
- Perform submarine swaps via the [Lightning Loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop) service
- Classify channels according to your node's operating mode
- Run a single binary that integrates both [`loopd`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/loop) and [`faraday`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/faraday) daemons all in one

## Installation
Download the latest binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-terminal/releases) page.

## Execution
Run Lightning Terminal with a local `lnd` instance:

```
./litd --uipassword=UP48lm4VjqxmOxB9X9stry6VTKBRQI
```

Visit https://localhost:8443 to access Terminal.

Note that a password with a minimum of 8 characters is required to run Lightning Terminal. In a production environment, it's recommended that you store this password as an environment variable to avoid it being recorded in the command history.

To use LiT with a remote `lnd` instance please [follow these instructions](./doc/config-lnd-remote.md). If you would like to replace your existing LND instance with the one integrated within LiT please see [configuring Terminal](./doc/config-lnd-integrated.md).

## Interaction
If you plan to run LiT on a remote machine but access the web-interface from your computer you may not want to deal with self-signed certificate browser warnings. To avoid these warnings configure the HTTP server to use a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). View the
[Let's Encrypt Configuration](./doc/letsencrypt.md) doc for instructions on how to configure this.

## Upgrading
If you used command line arguments with previous versions then you don't need to change anything when upgrading. 

To upgrade from v0.1.1-alpha or earlier simply create a `lit.conf` file in your LiT directory. The default location LiT uses depends on your operating system:
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Lit/lit.conf`
- Linux: `~/.lit/lit.conf`
- Windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/Lit/lit.conf`

Move all the configuration settings specific to LiT from `lnd.conf` to `lit.conf` and remove any previous LiT-specific customizations from the configuration settings in `lnd.conf`. Note that any section headers (`[ Example ]`) in `lit.conf` should be removed or changed to comments (`# Example`). 

## Usage
Read the [walkthrough](doc/WALKTHROUGH.md) document to learn more about how to use LiT.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues please see our [troubleshooting guide](./doc/troubleshooting.md).

## Build from source
If youâ€™d prefer to compile from source code please follow [these instructions](./doc/compile.md).
